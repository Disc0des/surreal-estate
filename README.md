# :house_with_garden: Surreal Estate React App

Backend module project with Manchester Codes. We were given a brief to design a React app which would store property details and allow the user to search properties from a given endpoint.

## Languages and Frameworks

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

## Testing Libraries

Jest, React testing library

## Packages Used

Axios, PropTypes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
